- Mobile-first workflow

### Useful resources

- [DOM Events](https://www.cookieshq.co.uk/posts/event-listeners-not-working-troublelshooting) - This helped me with DOM events. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.

- [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - This is an amazing article which helped me  understand Flexbox. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
